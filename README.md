**javimy** is a simple program written in java implementing several examples
(filters) of image edge-detection.


One of the most interesting thing that **javimy** is able to do is
vectorization.  Indeed it is able to convert any image to an svg file in a very
effective way (see examples).

For more infos look at the file: project.pdf and at the report ("rapport"
folder).
